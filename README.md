# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Classification
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Description:

Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.

Early Signs of Diabetes:

Hunger and fatigue. Our body converts the food we eat into glucose that our cells use for energy.
Peeing more often and being thirstier
Dry mouth and itchy skin
Blurred vision.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to predict whether or not a patient is suffering from Diabetes. The dataset consists of several independent/ predictor variables and a dependent/ target variable.

Models Used:
Logistic Regression for binary classification,Knn Algorithm,Naive Bayes,Decision Tree,Random Forest,Ada Boost
